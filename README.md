### Movies with streaming services
<p> The movies have changed a lot in these years, now we have movies with more visual effects and on several streaming platforms. so we have differents kinds of movies directly to our homes for diferents spectators.</p>
    
Streaming platforms have affected the production of movies?:
    
#### * The movies are shorter or longer?
#### * What are the most popular genres?


<p>WE will study a dataset from Netflix, this company which was pioneer offering streaming services in 1999. So to try to answer these questions we will analyse the catalog from this company</p>

Notes:
* Main idea of this analysis comes from Datacamp
* We tried to use loops, lists and dictionaries most of possible, thats why we didn't use methods as ".value_counts()"
